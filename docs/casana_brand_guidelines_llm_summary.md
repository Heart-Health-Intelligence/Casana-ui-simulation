- **Creative hook:** “**The innovation throne**”
- **Proposition:** A steadfast form factor that **passively captures vital trends when nature calls**.

### Personality pillars (primary)
**Ingenious · Objective · Good-humored · Practical**

Supporting traits to echo in tone and word choice:
- Innovative / breakthrough / brilliant
- Relatable / honest / authentic
- Scientific / trustworthy / nondiscriminatory

## 3) Voice, tone, and prose rules

### Brand persona
**“The Reliable Caretaker”**:
- Supportive, easy-going, never doubted
- Professional and precise (to earn trust) but relatable like real people
- Defers to providers for decisions (supports, doesn’t replace)
- Compliant/responsible, with occasional self-aware humor

### Tonal values (DO / DON’T)
1) **Credible, not clinical**  
2) **Insightful, not the authority**  
3) **Inventive, not magic**  
4) **Self-aware, not slapstick**  
5) **Effortless, not oversimplified**

**Humor guidance:** Use subtle, self-aware lines sparingly and match the audience/context (e.g., lighter consumer brand moments vs. clinical/professional settings).

### Writing mechanics (house style)
- Prefer **active voice**, unless passive is required for clarity or regulatory reasons.
- Keep copy **brief but not flippant or vague**; warm and conversational.
- With clinicians, provide enough detail to decide, while respecting time/attention.
- Introduce people first time with **full name + professional title** (when applicable).
- Address users by **first name** if they’re comfortable.
- Confirm and use stated **pronouns**.
- Refer to doctors/nurses/scientists with **credentials + last name** (e.g., “Dr. ___”).
- Use **contractions** to stay conversational, unless emphasis or regulatory requirements call for more formality.
- For general style questions, default to **Chicago Manual of Style**.

## 4) Product and positioning guardrails (claims & boundaries)

### “Who we are” (approved framing)
- Casana is the leader in smart toilet seat heart health monitoring.
- Sophisticated technology is **self-powered**, accessible, and easy to use regardless of ethnicity, gender, or age.
- Saves valuable time for care teams.

### “Who we are not” (avoid these traps)
- Not a toy/gadget;
- Inventive **not magic**: improves monitoring/outcomes but does not “solve” health issues.
- Effortless **not oversimplified**: science is sophisticated; consumer experience is easy.
- Data collection is **not intrusive**; data is not consumed/shared beyond approved authorities.

---

## 5) On-brand headline patterns (examples)

Use short, confident, human lines; “effortless,” “home,” “peace of mind,” and the occasional self-aware wink.

Examples to mirror:
- “Just sit. We’ll take it from here.”
- “Technology that passively captures health data when nature calls.”
- “Moving the center of care closer to home.”
- “Home is where the health insights are.”
- “Effortless consistency that uncovers heart health trends.”
